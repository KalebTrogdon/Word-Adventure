# Overview

Text based Adventure game using Python. This is a text based adventure game that I created using Python. The game is a simple text based game where the player is given a scenario and must make a choice. The game is designed to be played in the terminal and is a fun way to pass the time.

I mostly wanted to write a one player text style adventure game like I used to play back in the day. But I wanted to add in some new elements to make it more interesting. I am really interested in AI and wanted to see if I could implement some of that into the game.


# Development Environment

I mostly used Visual Studio Code to write the code for this project. I also used Python 3.12 to write the code.

# Useful Websites

I was mostly looking at Geeks for Geeks for help with this project.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- need to fix the game so it works better.
- need to add balancing features.
- need to implement AI.
